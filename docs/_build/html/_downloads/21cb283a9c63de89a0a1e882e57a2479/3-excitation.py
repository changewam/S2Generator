The Generation for Excitation Time Series
==================================================

This module will detail the generation and manipulation of our excitation time series data.
The diversity of our :math:`S^2` data generation mechanisms is primarily due to two factors: (1) the diversity of generated symbolic expressions (complex systems) :math:`f(\cdot)`; and (2) the diversity of generated excitation time series data :math:`X`.

We incorporate five different excitation time series generation mechanisms into the `Excitation <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/_interface.py>`_ object, including:

- `MixedDistribution <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/mixed_distribution.py>`_ : Mainly from the field of symbolic regression `SNIP <https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02227>`_ , this method is obtained by sampling from a mixture of Gaussian and uniform distributions.
- `AutoregressiveMovingAverage <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/autoregressive_moving_average.py>`_ : This method comes from the field of time series analysis of `SymTime <#>`_ , which constructs a stationary time series as the excitation signal by building a random parameterized ARMA model.
- `ForecastPFN <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/forecast_pfn.py>`_ : This method is derived from `ForecastPFN <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01933>`_ , which is used to train zero-shot forecasting models on synthetic time series data. It considers time series data as a composition of trends and cycles based on the decomposition idea.
- `KernelSynth <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/kernel_synth.py>`_ : This method comes from `Chronos <https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815>`_ and generates excitation signals by constructing different periods and trends in the form of a combination of multiple different linear and nonlinear kernels.
- `IntrinsicModeFunction <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/intrinsic_mode_functions.py>`_ : This method is based on the idea of signal decomposition in `PySDKit <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/PySDKit>`_ and constructs the excitation signal by combining the eigenmode function with different signal and noise sequences.
