Participate in Our Project
--------------------------------

You can participate in the development of S2Generator in the following ways.

Using S2Generator
++++++++++++

Although numerous large-scale time series pre-training datasets are available for foundational model pre-training, 
the field of time series still faces challenges of data scarcity and imbalanced distribution when compared to images in computer vision or large language models in natural language processing.

To address this, S2Generator approaches time series from the perspective of complex dynamics, 
considering time series data as external manifestations of complex systems. Based on this viewpoint, 
we propose a flexible data generation mechanism capable of producing high-quality time series without constraints.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could incorporate the data generated by S2Generator into the pre-training of your foundational models. 
Furthermore, you are welcome to submit your work to be featured and promoted in our documentation.

It is our sincere hope that S2Generator can contribute to the pre-training of foundational models in the time series domain and help address practical challenges.


Bug Discovery
++++++++++++
 
If you discover any bug while using S2Generator, we welcome you to push an issue in the `issues <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/issues>`_ section on Github, and we'll address it promptly.
Or, you can submit your changes directly to the master branch, and we'll review and merge your code.

The success of this project would not have been possible without the support and contributions of many individuals.

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to `Kai Wu <https://web.xidian.edu.cn/kwu/>`_ from the School of Artificial Intelligence in Xidian University. 
He introduced me to the perspective of complex dynamical systems in time series, enabling me to move beyond the data-driven mindset of machine learning and deep learning, 
and to approach time series data from a more macroscopic viewpoint rooted in its fundamental nature. 
This led to the development of the S2Generator data generation mechanism and the my first time series foundation model, 
`SymTime <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/SymTime>`_ trained on it. Through this method, we have successfully alleviated the issues of scarcity and imbalanced distribution in time series data to some extent.

I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to my master's supervisor, `Dan Wang <https://web.xidian.edu.cn/danwang/>`_ from the School of Telecommunications Engineering in Xidian University. 
She provided invaluable guidance and support during my undergraduate studies, helping me develop scientific thinking, innovation capabilities, and academic writing skills.

My appreciation goes to my junior `Rezhe Wang <https://github.com/changewam>`_ majoring in software engineering, 
for his efforts and contributions to the technical documentation of S2Generator and another project of ours `PySDKit <https://github.com/wwhenxuan/PySDKit>`_. 
The documentation you see is largely thanks to Rezhe's hard work.

I am grateful to my peer `Yifan Wu <https://github.com/changewam>`_ for his contributions to the differential equations and unit testing aspects of S2Generator, 
which ensured the correct operation of our data generation mechanism.

I would like to thank my close friend Baixiang Wang for his encouragement and support in programming and research. 
There were times when we felt lost, constantly coding and training deep neural networks as if searching for an exit in the shadows. 
It was only with your companionship and help that I was able to persevere.

Lastly, I extend my thanks to my high school classmate Mengyao Zhang for designing the exquisite and meaningful logo for S2Generator. 
This logo will continue to be used in all subsequent models trained with the S2 data generation mechanism and related papers.
