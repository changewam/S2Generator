    We are excited to announce the first official release of ``S2Generator``!

    We are thrilled to share that our accompanying paper, "Synthetic Series-Symbol Data Generation for Time Series Foundation Models," has been accepted by NeurIPS 2025! In this research, our SymTime model,
    pre-trained on the synthetic dataset generated by S2Generator , achieved state-of-the-art results in fine-tuning across critical time series tasks, including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection.

    This release marks a significant step towards advancing the capabilities of time series foundation models by providing an unparalleled source of synthetic training data. We invite you to explore S2Generator and its potential to unlock new possibilities in time series analysis.
