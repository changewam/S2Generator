Excitation Generation via ForecastPFN
========================================

In this example, we demonstrate how to generate incentive signals based on the method of time series combination proposed in `ForecastPFN <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01933>`_. The paper primarily trained a zero-shot time series prediction model using a prior feature fitting network approach on a large amount of synthetic data.

In the S2Generator, we have improved the data generation method from the original code and provided a Python-based object-oriented programming interface to make parameter management and invocation easier.

The original code link is: https://github.com/abacusai/ForecastPFN.

This method considers the time series :math:`y_t` to be composed of trends and a large number of cyclical components with different frequencies. These cyclical components include weeks, months, and years. Finally, some random noise is added to the generated sequence data. For the target generated time series :math:`y_t`, we can view it as a combination of trends and cycles:

.. math::
   y_t = \phi(t) \cdot z_t = \mathrm{trend}(t) \cdot \mathrm{seasonal}(t) \cdot z_t,

where, :math:`z_t` is the noise time series and can be represented as

.. math::
   z_t = 1 + m_{\mathrm{noise}}(z - \\bar{z}),

where, :math:`z_t` is the noise time series and can be represented as

.. math::
   z_t = 1 + m_{\mathrm{noise}}(z - \\bar{z}),

where, :math:`z \sim \mathrm{Weibull}(1, k)`, :math:`\\bar{z} = (\mathrm{ln}2) ^ {1 / k}`.

The trend component is made up of a linear and exponential component with coefficients:

.. math::
   \mathrm{trend}(t) = (1 + m_{\mathrm{linear}} \cdot t + c_{\mathrm{linear}})(m_{\mathrm{exp}} \cdot c_{\mathrm{exp} ^ t}),

where, :math:`m_{\mathrm{linear}}, m_{\mathrm{exp}} ~ \mathcal{N}(-0.01, 0.5)`, :math:`c_{\mathrm{linear}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.01)`, :math:`c_{\mathrm{exp}} \sim \mathcal N (1, 0.0005)`.

For the periodic components, we model them based on the basic idea of Fourier decomposition, representing the periodic components as a combination of different sine and cosine signals, and combining them according to weeks, months, and years. Specifically, it can be expressed as:

.. math::
   \mathrm{seasonal}(t) = \mathrm{seasonal_{week}}(t) \cdot \mathrm{seasonal_{month}}(t) \cdot \mathrm{seasonal_{year}}(t),

where, the seasonal can be represented as

.. math::
   \mathrm{seasonal}_{\\nu}(t) = 1 + m_{\\nu} \sum_{f = 1}^{\left \lfloor p_{\\nu / 2} \\right \\rfloor }\left [ c_{f, \\nu} \mathrm{sin} \left ( 2 \pi f \\frac{t}{p_{\\nu}} \\right ) + d_{f, \\nu} \mathrm{cos} \left ( 2 \pi f \\frac{t}{p_{\\nu}} \\right ) \\right ].

We set each :math:`m_{\\nu} \in \left \{ \mathrm{week}, \mathrm{month}, \mathrm{year} \\right \}`, separately for daily, weekly, and monthly, as follows. :math:`\\nu = 0` unless specified:

where, the seasonal can be represented as:

.. math::
   \mathrm{seasonal}_{\\nu}(t) = 1 + m_{\\nu} \sum_{f = 1}^{\left \lfloor p_{\\nu / 2} \\right \\rfloor }\left [ c_{f, \\nu} \mathrm{sin} \left ( 2 \pi f \\frac{t}{p_{\\nu}} \\right ) + d_{f, \\nu} \mathrm{cos} \left ( 2 \pi f \\frac{t}{p_{\\nu}} \\right ) \\right ].

We set each :math:`m_{\\nu} \in \left \{ \mathrm{week}, \mathrm{month}, \mathrm{year} \\right \}`, separately for daily, weekly, and monthly, as follows. :math:`\\nu = 0` unless specified:

 - Daily: :math:`m_{\mathrm{week}} \sim \mathcal{U}([0, 1])`, :math:`m_{\mathrm{month}} \sim \mathcal{U}([0, 2])`, :math:`p_{\mathrm{week}} = 7`, :math:`p_{\mathrm{week}} = 30.5`.
 - Weekly: :math:`m_{\mathrm{week}} \sim \mathcal{U}([0, 3])`, :math:`m_{\mathrm{month}} \sim \mathcal{U}([0, 1])`, :math:`p_{\mathrm{week}} = 2`, :math:`p_{\mathrm{week}} = 52`.
 - Monthly: :math:`m_{\mathrm{year}} \sim \sim \mathcal{U}([0, 5])`, :math:`p_{\mathrm{year}} = 12`.
