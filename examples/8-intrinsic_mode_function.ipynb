    "# Excitation Generation via Intrinsic Mode Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is primarily inspired by adaptive decomposition algorithms in signal processing. For the first few methods, the excitation time series sampled from a mixed distribution exhibit strong randomness.\n",
    "The excitation time series sampled from an ARMA($p$, $q$) model primarily reflect the continuity and temporal dependencies of time series data (mainly in terms of trend characteristics).\n",
    "In contrast, time series generated by methods such as ForecastPFN and KernelSynth incorporate both trend and periodic characteristics of time series.\n",
    "Therefore, to specifically capture the periodicity of time series data, we generate excitation time series data based on the perspective of intrinsic mode functions, leveraging the [`PySDKit`](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/PySDKit) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**About Signal Decomposition**: Since the introduction of the **Hilbert-Huang Transform** in 1998, signal decomposition have become one of the most effective **time-frequency analysis** techniques in the 21st century.\n",
    "These methods adaptively decompose a signal or time series through iterative processes in the time domain and filtering in the frequency domain,\n",
    "thereby overcoming the limitations of Fourier transform in handling non-linear and non-stationary signals,\n",
    "as well as the issue of basis function selection in wavelet transform.\n",
    "In signal decomposition, the resulting sub-signals with specific amplitudes and frequencies are referred to as **Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)**,\n",
    "which are amplitude-modulated-frequency-modulated (AM-FM) signals, expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_k(t) = A_k (t) \\mathrm{cos}(\\phi_k (t) ),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where, the phase $\\phi_k (t)$ is a non-decreasing function, $\\phi_k'(t) \\ge 0$, the envelope is non-negative $A_k(t) \\ge 0$, and, very importantly, both the envelope $A_k (t)$ and the instantaneous frequency $\\omega_{k} (t) := \\phi_{k}' (t)$ vary much slower than the phase $\\phi_k (t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally believed that a complex signal in the real world is often composed of multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). When dealing with real physical systems, it is often necessary to extract and analyze a specific IMF, which requires the use of signal decomposition algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal decomposition algorithms are mainly divided into time-domain iterative methods, such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and its variants, and frequency-domain filtering methods, such as Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). We have integrated EMD, STL, and VMD algorithms into S2Generator. If you are interested in adaptive signal decomposition, you may want to explore another project we developed: [`PySDKit`](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/PySDKit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the majority of scholars in the signal processing field use MATLAB as their primary programming language, while Python dominates the machine learning and deep learning platforms. This discrepancy has prevented many advanced signal decomposition algorithms from being effectively integrated with deep learning techniques. To address this issue, we developed [`PySDKit`](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/PySDKit), which is designed to facilitate direct algorithm invocation and promote the advancement of time series analysis from the perspective of signal processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, we consider the time series $y(t)$ as a combination of multiple different intrinsic mode functions $u_k(t)$ and the gaussian noise sequence $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n",
    "These eigenmodes can be sine and cosine signals, amplitude modulated (AM) signals, sawtooth wave signals, and other signals.\n",
    "We first determine the number of signals to use and then generate the corresponding intrinsic mode functions and their weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(t) = \\sum_{k} w_k \\times u_k(t) + \\epsilon,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where, $w_k$ is the random weight for the IMFs $u_k (t)$ and is normalized by $\\sum_{k} w_k = 1$.\n"
